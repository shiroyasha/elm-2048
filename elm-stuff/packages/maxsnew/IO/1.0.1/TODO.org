* TODO
  - [-] Make compilation packagable
    - [X] Remove need for elm-runtime.js to be in the repo. (new feature?)
    - [ ] Allow node modules to import elm IO modules
      - Look at https://github.com/arsatiki/elmloader
    - [ ] Allow elm IO modules to import node modules
  - [X] Get rid of the `every millisecond` pump in the interpreter
    - Should be able to do this by sending lists of requests
  - [ ] Add error handling
    - [ ] Use the Either monad?
      - Possibly add special binds for EitherT IO/Either (?>>=)
    - [ ] What to do with exceptions?
  - [ ] More IO primitives
    - [ ] File operations
    - [ ] Network operations
    - [ ] Concurrency operations (simulated coroutines)
    - [ ] Mutable variables
  - [ ] Applications using IO
    - [ ] Interpreter
    - [ ] Server
    - [ ] Bindings into external libraries (basically an IO FFI built
          on top of the real FFI)
